# UN Human Trafficking Analysis

This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing human trafficking trends across different geographic regions over the last decade using Python and Power BI.

## Overview

The project aims to provide insights into human trafficking patterns globally by analyzing a dataset obtained from the United Nations. It involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends and visualizing the findings using a Power BI dashboard.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the United Nations website and contains information on human trafficking incidents across various regions and years.

## Code

The EDA code is available in the Jupyter Notebook. This notebook contains Python code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides interactive visualizations to explore human trafficking trends, including maps highlighting hotspots, year-wise incident trends, customizable sliders for data filtering, and total victim counts by category. You can view the dashboard here:
